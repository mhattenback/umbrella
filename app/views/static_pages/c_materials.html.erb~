  Umbrella Roofing and Siding is proud to be the first company certified with Gaco Western as 
  Gaco Qualified Applicators on Long Island. Whether youâ€™re rehabbing an existing foam roof or 
  coating a new metal roof, Gaco Western has a roof system to meet your needs.  Gaco spray foam 
  and coatings provide seamless insulation and waterproofing, and are fully adhered to the substrate. 
  This eliminates common sources of leaks and pooling water beneath roofing material. 
  Gaco coatings are elastomeric, meaning they are able to stretch as the substrate warms and cools 
  through the day and through the seasons.  Characterized by high physical properties, GacoFlex 
  coatings are tough enough to withstand years of abuse by sun and weather.
  Gaco has also developed roof systems to meet specific project requirements.  
  From quick-set spray applications, to highly reflective coatings designed to lower your energy bills, 
  Gaco has the breadth and depth of applications to get your project done well and done on time. Click the links
  below for specific information on the application most suited to your roof.
